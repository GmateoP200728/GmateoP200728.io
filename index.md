## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs


Lab 6 part 2 
This lab is one of my favorites because when it was mentioned how we would program this I got curious about how. Then we had a lab about it which is cool. I understand how it was supposed to work with the face cards, Ace, and number cards going through them and seeing which card is which whats the value ect. But I like this lab because I wasn’t able to finish it I couldn’t figure out how to see the A cards and face cards values it just wouldn’t work, which just kept making me think more and more on what I was missing no matter how much I looked back at my code i couldn’t figure it out.

Lab 1 
This lab is my favorite because it was the easiest lab and was the first lab of the year. I liked this lab because it was getting me used to the new way to code and repository, which I like. It's all cool, it was the beginning of the labs, and even after this I struggled with remembering how to get to the terminal, to clone, ls, cd, and code but I would always come back to this one.

Lab 8 part 1 
This lab is one of my favorites because when it was explained I was confused at first and how we would put it to code. Then seeing how the arguments work and using stod, and being able to drop the highest scores and lowest score was very interesting to me and how we were able to do that with the code. Even though this lab my partner was blazing through knowing what to put it made me learn from them on what they did to figure out how to figure out some code not knowing.
